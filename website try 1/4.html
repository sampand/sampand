	Lately I've been playing a lot of animal crossing?? It started with new horizons, but lately I've been playing pocket camp, and it's been a really nice break from the stress of the world. I think I want to start playing a little more structured of a game again though... when I'm less busy, I'll probably start playing Breath of the Wild again. That game is so freaking beautiful!
